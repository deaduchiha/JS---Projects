# OpenWeatherMap API

The OpenWeatherMap API is a powerful tool for accessing weather data from around the world. By making HTTP requests to their API endpoints, developers can retrieve current weather conditions, forecasts, and more.

To get started with the OpenWeatherMap API, you will need to sign up for an API key on their website. This key will be used to authenticate your requests and ensure that you have access to the data you need.

## How to Use

1. Sign up for an API key on the OpenWeatherMap website.
2. Make HTTP requests to the appropriate API endpoints, such as:
   - Current weather data
   - 5-day weather forecast
   - Hourly forecast
   - Weather maps
3. Parse the JSON response to extract the weather data you require for your application.
4. Handle errors and edge cases gracefully to provide a seamless user experience.
